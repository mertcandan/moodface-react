# Moodface

Structure of Moodface is based on the assumption that writing is performance. The main purpose is to provide a responsive operational framework in which writing speed data could be collected. It is suggested that affect controls or changes physical actions. That is, considering that writing is already learned, it is a behavioural level action (action patterns that are not inherent but can be done without thinking about how to do it, i.e. chopping vegetables to cook, playing an instrument). So, affect could be extracted from action if correct metrics are developed.
On the backhand there is a simple algorithm that processes the keyboard input. On the front-end, Moodface provides a blank writable page.
